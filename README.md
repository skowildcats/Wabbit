# Wabbit
## Description 
  Wabbit is a goals and habit tracker that allows users to design their own interfaces and track their productivity and improvement. Wabbit aggregates and quantifies data in realtime to provide realtime feedback for their accomplishments. Because sticking to a habit is particularly challenging in its nascent stages, Wabbit is designed to continuously respond to user actions. Because every user has unique goals in mind, individuals should immediately be presented with tools to customize the interface to fit their needs. Each users' page should truly belong to them. Furthermore, data and other personal performance metrics will be visualized in a separate 'analytics' or 'statistics' page for each user as they use the app for longer periods of time.
